The following definitions apply to the "Churn_Modelling" database:

- CreditScore:    A numerical value between 350 and 850 representing the customer's 
                  creditworthiness. Scores below 400 are considered "High Risk".

- Tenure:         Number of years the customer has been with the bank.
                  * Loyalty Tier: Tenure > 7 years is considered "Loyal".

- NumOfProducts:  Number of bank products the customer uses (e.g., savings, credit card, loan).
                  * Risk Alert: Customers with 3 or 4 products have a higher churn rate due to 
                    potential dissatisfaction with complex portfolio management.

- HasCrCard:      1 = Customer holds a credit card. 0 = No credit card.

- IsActiveMember: 1 = Active (at least one transaction in the last 30 days). 
                  0 = Inactive.

- EstimatedSalary: Annual estimated salary in EUR.

- Exited:         This is the target variable for churn prediction.
                  1 = CHURNED (Customer closed account and left).
                  0 = RETAINED (Customer is still with the bank).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Definition of High-Value Churn

a Balance greater than €100,000. These cases must be prioritized for analysis.

2.2 Retention Strategy
- For customers with a CreditScore > 650 and Tenure > 5 years, the bank authorizes 
  a retention bonus of €50 if their churn probability exceeds 60%.
  
2.3 Privacy
- The 'Surname' column must be excluded from predictive modeling to ensure ethical AI practices 
  and prevent bias.
